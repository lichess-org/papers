  abstract      = {This report encompasses the implementation of two state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms for evaluating chess positions. The first algorithm makes use of artificial neural networks and manual feature representation thus closely following the implementation and architecture of Matthew Lai's Giraffe.  Giraffe learns to play chess largely by self-play and derives its own rules based on the data [1]. Giraffe was implemented as a 7 class classification problem on a dataset of over 10,000 grandmaster level games. Four different implementations of Giraffe were explored covering two different architectures and the effects of regularization on the model performance. The second algorithm implemented goes through an unsupervised learning phase to perform feature extraction followed by a supervised learning phase thus replicating David Eli's DeepChess. DeepChess evaluates chess positions using a deep neural network without any a priori knowledge regarding the rules of chess. DeepChess is implemented as a siamese network of two disjoint deep belief networks connected to each other by fully connected layers [2]. This architecture was implemented as a binary classification problem on the same dataset as Giraffe and also on a larger dataset of LiChess games. Different implementations of DeepChess covering different training methodologies and parameter sets were executed.},

Recently, however, attempts have been made to create engines that mimic the playing strength and style of human players. Our research proposes enhancements of models developed in this vein that more accurately imitate master-level players, as well as improve the prediction accuracy of existing models on weaker players. Our proposed enhancements are simple to apply by post-processing the output of existing chess engines. The performance of our enhancements was evaluated and compared using two metrics, prediction accuracy and average centipawn loss. We found that using an ensemble model over search depths maximised prediction accuracy, while an evaluation window filtering approach was preferable with respect to average centipawn loss.},

    Recent progress in machine learning has been fueled by increasing scale, enabling breakthroughs in domains such as image generation, natural language understanding, and decision-making. While tremendous improvements have been realized for low-risk applications like chat completion and recommendation, there are fundamental challenges that need to be addressed for high-risk applications like robotics and security. Specifically, this thesis is motivated by the following issues: (1) Collecting large datasets often relies on crowdsourcing, which inevitably introduces heterogeneous and potentially suboptimal data. (2) Applications that require coordination between multiple agents are often coupled with risk, making it challenging to use decentralized learning algorithms. (3) While neural networks have demonstrated tremendous predictive capabilities, they are inherently fragile to adversarial attacks. In this thesis, we present algorithms for combatting these challenges within the domains of Reinforcement Learning and Adversarial Machine Learning.

    The first contribution introduces two algorithms for imitation learning in suboptimal settings, demonstrating that by modeling the suboptimalities present, we can improve the learning framework. The second contribution proposes a mechanism to encourage cooperation in multi-agent reinforcement learning, demonstrating that by allowing agents to gift part of their reward, we can promote prosocial behavior in a decentralized fashion. The third contribution develops a robust classification algorithm designed for sparse attacks, demonstrating that by extending our theoretical insights from idealized settings, we can combat adversarial attacks in neural network classifiers. We test our proposed algorithms across applications in image-classification, game-playing, and robotics. Together, these contributions aim to advance the deployment of machine learning in real-world scenarios by considering practical problem settings, presenting novel theoretical and algorithmic insights, and validating these findings empirically.

  abstract      = {From sports to science, the recent availability of large-scale data has allowed to gain insights on the drivers of human innovation and success in a variety of domains. Here we quantify human performance in the popular game of chess by leveraging a very large dataset comprising of over 120 million games between almost 1 million players. We find that individuals encounter hot streaks of repeated success, longer for beginners than for expert players, and even longer cold streaks of unsatisfying performance. Skilled players can be distinguished from the others based on their gaming behaviour. Differences appear from the very first moves of the game, with experts tending to specialize and repeat the same openings while beginners explore and diversify more. However, experts experience a broader response repertoire, and display a deeper understanding of different variations within the same line. Over time, the opening diversity of a player tends to decrease, hinting at the development of individual playing styles. Nevertheless, we find that players are often not able to recognize their most successful openings. Overall, our work contributes to quantifying human performance in competitive settings, providing a first large-scale quantitative analysis of individual careers in chess, helping unveil the determinants separating elite from beginner performance.},

This phenomenon has been observed repeatedly in over-the-board games between high-level players and professionals. However, less is known about the prevalence of white's advantage in games played between amateurs in more casual settings. This article attempts to identify a first-move advantage in chess by examining a large database of amateur games played online on a dedicated chess website. Win rates are calculated for various rating levels, and the influence of opening move choice is also explored. These results can help determine whether there is an inherent first-move advantage in chess observable for all players in multiple settings, or if this effect is exclusively seen with players of high skill during games played in person.},

In response to the proliferation of such models, the field of Explainable AI (XAI) has sought to develop techniques that enhance the transparency and interpretability of machine learning methods. In this work, we consider a question not previously explored within the XAI and ML communities: Given a computational system whose performance exceeds that of its human user, can explainable AI capabilities be leveraged to improve the performance of the human? We study this question in the context of the game of Chess, for which computational game engines that surpass the performance of the average player are widely available. We introduce the Rationale-Generating Algorithm, an automated technique for generating rationales for utility-based computational methods, which we evaluate with a multi-day user study against two baselines. The results show that our approach produces rationales that lead to statistically significant improvement in human task performance, demonstrating that rationales automatically generated from an AI's internal task model can be used not only to explain what the system is doing, but also to instruct the user and ultimately improve their task performance.},

In this paper, we use the games played in an online chess platform to exploit the ``wisdom of the crowd'' and answer questions traditionally tackled only by chess experts. We first define a relatedness network of chess openings that quantifies how similar two openings are to play. Using this network, we identify communities of nodes corresponding to the most common opening choices and their mutual relationships. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the relatedness network can be used to forecast future openings players will start to play, with back-tested predictions outperforming a random predictor. We then apply the Economic Fitness and Complexity algorithm to measure the difficulty of openings and players' skill levels. Our study not only provides a new perspective on chess analysis but also opens the possibility of suggesting personalized opening recommendations using complex network theory.},

While these are critical benchmarks of progress, they also suffer from weakness due to artificial distributions and incomplete knowledge. Artifacts arising from artificial distributions can overstate language model performance, while incomplete knowledge limits fine-grained analysis. In this work, we introduce a complementary benchmarking approach based on SimPlified Language Activity Traces (SPLAT). SPLATs are corpora of language encodings of activity in some closed domain (we study traces from chess and baseball games in this work). SPLAT datasets use naturally-arising distributions, allow the generation of question-answer pairs at scale, and afford complete knowledge in their closed domains. We show that language models of three different architectures can answer questions about world states using only verb-like encodings of activity. Our approach is extensible to new language models and additional question-answering tasks.},

Each problem within these datasets is annotated with numerical difficulty scores. To systematically estimate problem difficulties, we collect abundant performance data on attempts to each problem by humans in the real world or LLMs on the prominent leaderboard. Leveraging the rich performance data, we apply well-established difficulty ranking systems, such as Item Response Theory (IRT) and Glicko-2 models, to uniformly assign numerical difficulty scores to problems. Moreover, datasets in Easy2Hard-Bench distinguish themselves from previous collections by a higher proportion of challenging problems. Through extensive experiments with six state-of-the-art LLMs, we provide a comprehensive analysis of their performance and generalization capabilities across varying levels of difficulty, with the aim of inspiring future research in LLM generalization.

  abstract      = {With the growing capabilities of AI, technology is increasingly able to match or even surpass human performance. In the current study, focused on the game of chess, we investigated whether chess players could distinguish if they were playing against a human or a computer, and how they achieved this. A total of 24 chess players each played eight 5+0 Blitz games from different starting positions. They played against (1) a human, (2) Maia, a neural network-based chess engine trained to play in a human-like manner, (3) Stockfish 16, the best chess engine available, downgraded to play at a lower level, and (4) Stockfish 16 at its maximal level. The opponent's move time was fixed at 10 seconds. During the game, participants verbalized their thoughts, and after each game, they indicated by means of a questionnaire whether they thought they had played against a human or a machine and if there were particular moves that revealed the nature of the opponent. The results showed that Stockfish at the highest level was usually correctly identified as an engine, while Maia was often incorrectly identified as a human. The moves of the downgraded Stockfish were relatively often labeled as `strange' by the participants. In conclusion, the Turing test, as applied here in a domain where computers can perform superhumanly, is essentially a test of whether the chess computer can devise suboptimal moves that correspond to human moves, and not necessarily a test of computer intelligence.},

We then explore how piece values change when we analyze material imbalances at various stages of a chess game.

  annote        = {Chess is a strategy board game with its inception dating back to the 15th century. The Covid-19 pandemic has led to a chess boom online with 95,853,038 chess games being played during January, 2021 on lichess.com. Along with the chess boom, instances of cheating have also become more rampant. Classifications have been used for anomaly detection in different fields and thus it is a natural idea to develop classifiers to detect cheating in chess. However, there are no specific examples of this, and it is difficult to obtain data where cheating has occurred. So, in this paper, we develop 4 machine learning classifiers, Linear Discriminant Analysis, Quadratic Discriminant Analysis, Multinomial Logistic Regression, and K-Nearest Neighbour classifiers to predict chess game results and explore predictors that produce the best accuracy performance. We use Confusion Matrix, K Fold Cross-Validation, and Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation methods to find the accuracy metrics. There are three phases of analysis. In phase I, we train classifiers using 1.94 million over the board game as training data and 20 thousand online games as testing data and obtain accuracy metrics. In phase II, we select a smaller pool of 212 games, select additional predictor variables from chess engine evaluation of the moves played in those games and check whether the inclusion of the variables improve performance. Finally, in phase III, we investigate for patterns in misclassified cases to define anomalies. From phase I, the models are not performing at a utilizable level of accuracy (44-63\%). For all classifiers, it is no better than deciding the class with a coin toss. K-Nearest Neighbour with K = 7 was the best model. In phase II, adding the new predictors improved the performance of all the classifiers significantly across all validation methods. In fact, using only significant variables as predictors produced highly accurate classifiers. Finally, from phase III, we could not find any patterns or significant differences between the predictors for both correct classifications and misclassifications. In conclusion, machine learning classification is only one useful tool to spot instances that indicates anomalies. However, we cannot simply judge anomalous games using only this method.},

  abstract      = {Abstract Gambits are central to human decision-making. Our goal is to provide a theory of Gambits. A Gambit is a combination of psychological and technical factors designed to disrupt predictable play. Chess provides an environment to study gambits and behavioral game theory. Our theory is based on the Bellman optimality path for sequential decision-making. This allows us to calculate the Q\$\$ Q \$\$-values of a Gambit where material (usually a pawn) is sacrificed for dynamic play. On the empirical side, we study the effectiveness of a number of popular chess Gambits. This is a natural setting as chess Gambits require a sequential assessment of a set of moves (a.k.a. policy) after the Gambit has been accepted. Our analysis uses Stockfish 14.1 to calculate the optimal Bellman Q\$\$ Q \$\$-values, which fundamentally measures if a position is winning or losing. To test whether Bellman's equation holds in play, we estimate the transition probabilities to the next board state via a database of expert human play. This then allows us to test whether the Gambiteer is following the optimal path in his decision-making. Our methodology is applied to the popular Stafford and reverse Stafford (a.k.a. Boden–Kieretsky–Morphy) Gambit and other common ones including the Smith–Morra, Goring, Danish and Halloween Gambits. We build on research in human decision-making by proving an irrational skewness preference within agents in chess. We conclude with directions for future research.},

  abstract      = {With the development of chess engines, cheating online has never been easier, resulting in a need for more robust and accurate detection systems. This paper presents a novel approach to chess cheater detection that combines conventional chess engines and neural networks to help identify which games are authentically played by humans and which show signs of extraneous intervention. By utilizing Stockfish to measure centipawn loss and its mathematical derivatives, we can measure deviations from typical computer-generated moves much like in conventional anti-cheat systems. Additionally, the neural network Maia, designed specifically to mimic human play, transmutes centipawn loss data to highlight deviations from human style. This dual-measurement system addresses the limitations of the given traditional anti-cheat systems, which face the issue of distinguishing between strong human players and those using engines. The collected metadata is analyzed using a sequential neural network, which identifies patterns of fair play violation. Our approach offers a robust solution for maintaining the integrity of online chess by accurately detecting and preventing cheating.},

  abstract      = {Context: This study aims to confirm, replicate and extend the findings of a previous article entitled ''Metamorphic Testing of Chess Engines'' that reported inconsistencies in the analyses provided by Stockfish, the most widely used chess engine, for transformed chess positions that are fundamentally identical. Initial findings, under conditions strictly identical to those of the original study, corroborate the reported inconsistencies. Objective: However, the original article considers a specific dataset (including randomly generated chess positions, end-games, or checkmate problems) and very low analysis depth (10 plies11A ply refers to a single turn taken by one player in a game. Two plies, one from each player, together constitute a complete move., corresponding to 5 moves). These decisions pose threats that limit generalizability of the results, but also their practical usefulness both for chess players and maintainers of Stockfish. Thus, we replicate the original study. Methods: We consider this time (1) positions derived from actual chess games, (2) analyses at appropriate and larger depths, and (3) different versions of Stockfish. We conduct novel experiments on thousands of positions, employing significantly deeper searches. Results: The replication results show that the Stockfish chess engines demonstrate significantly greater consistency in its evaluations. The metamorphic relations are not as effective as in the original article, especially on realistic chess positions. We also demonstrate that, for any given position, there exists a depth threshold beyond which further increases in depth do not result in any evaluation differences for the studied metamorphic relations. We perform an in-depth analysis to identify and clarify the implementation reasons behind Stockfish's inconsistencies when dealing with transformed positions. Conclusion: A first concrete result is thus that metamorphic testing of chess engines is not yet an effective technique for finding faults of Stockfish. Another result is the lessons learned through this replication effort: metamorphic relations must be verified in the context of the domain's specificities; without such contextual validation, they may lead to misleading or irrelevant conclusions; changes in parameters and input dataset can drastically alter the effectiveness of a testing method.},

  abstract      = {As online platforms become ubiquitous, there is growing concern that their use can potentially lead to negative outcomes in users' personal lives, such as disrupted sleep and impacted social relationships. A central question in the literature studying these problematic effects is whether they are associated with the amount of time users spend on online platforms. This is often addressed by either analyzing self-reported measures of time spent online, which are generally inaccurate, or using objective metrics derived from server logs or tracking software. Nonetheless, how the two types of time measures comparatively relate to problematic effects -- whether they complement or are redundant with each other in predicting problematicity -- remains unknown. Additionally, transparent research into this question is hindered by the literature's focus on closed platforms with inaccessible data, as well as selective analytical decisions that may lead to reproducibility issues.In this work, we investigate how both self-reported and data-derived metrics of time spent relate to potentially problematic effects arising from the use of an open, non-profit online chess platform. These effects include disruptions to sleep, relationships, school and work performance, and self-control. To this end, we distributed a gamified survey to players and linked their responses with publicly-available game logs. We find problematic effects to be associated with both self-reported and data-derived usage measures to similar degrees. However, analytical models incorporating both self-reported and actual time explain problematic effects significantly more effectively than models with either type of measure alone. Furthermore, these results persist across thousands of possible analytical decisions when using a robust and transparent statistical framework. This suggests that the two methods of measuring time spent measure contain distinct, complementary information about problematic usage outcomes and should be used in conjunction with each other.},

From social networks connecting us to each other, to content providers keeping us perpetually entertained, to search engines serving each of our informational needs, to computational models informing us how healthy we are, to artificially-intelligent coaches supplementing our natural intelligence, every corner of human existence is permeated by the digital tools we create. Accompanying the boons of these systems, however, are increasingly complex risks to our digital health. Our attention is pulled into cyberspace via algorithms that use billions of datapoints to learn what we like, sometimes to the detriment of our physical wellness. Ideological rifts online threaten our societal harmony as partisans become ever more polarized, whose obsession with political content in turn feeds the underbelly of our social media ecosystem. All the while, the same data underpinning these online interactions also allow others to make finely-optimized decisions about us, often to the detriment of the disadvantaged. This thesis offers a more optimistic vision: that the same computational infrastructure powering our potentially perilous systems can be repurposed to help us understand their perils. We first outline a framework for rigorously assessing the welfare of our digital systems through the well-being of individual users, the cohesion of user communities, and whether the systems themselves deserve trust. We then utilize this framework to conduct four empirical studies measuring the extent to which digital welfare is preserved or endangered by data-driven systems. At the level of individual users, we directly measure how spending time on a large-scale chess platform, Lichess, can be perceived as detrimental to personal well-being. We find that perceived harms are explained not only by the time that people believe they spend online, but also the actual time they spend engaging with the platform. For groups of users, we quantify how partisan users on the Reddit platform are selective towards politically-congruent news outlets, thus consuming and disseminating polarized news. Despite the platform appearing polarized on aggregate, we discover that narrow, hyper-partisan communities are responsible for deeply-ingrained ideological segregation. We then extend this result by identifying whether key individuals can influence the news consumption cycle on Reddit. Through an analysis of where news about political figures is shared on Reddit and the language it attracts, we illustrate that nationally-recognizable politicians are selectively discussed more by in-group online communities than they are by in-group news outlets. Out-group communities, on the other hand, generate the most toxic and hateful commentary. At the level of problematic downstream outcomes, we further probe whether people can tell when systems like algorithmic risk assessments harm data subjects in unfair ways. We find that observers are easily distracted by who makes risk assessments rather than how equitable the assessments are, suggesting that the task of welfare measurement itself needs to be made accessible for laypeople at large. This thesis posits that the online social systems jeopardizing our collective welfare can also be used to understand the very dangers they pose. By empirically measuring how well people are doing when they use or are impacted by these systems, we in turn empirically demonstrate the feasibility of this ideal. We conclude by speculating on the imminent ubiquity of artificial intelligence in our cyber-environment and their implications for the work in this thesis.},

Such exploration spawned what has become the benchmark of evaluating professional chess players since the 1970s: the Elo rating model. The Elo system, the first to have a sound statistical basis, was designed by Elo (1978) from the assumption that the performance of a player in a game is a normally distributed random variable Alliot (2017). However, this ranking model is not without its limitations and such has led to extreme rating deflation of the World Chess Federation (FIDE) Standard Elo rating system Sonas (2023). Such attention on the FIDE's rating mechanism has ignited focus on the Elo system's drawbacks which we will address in this dissertation.},

Recent proposals have suggested that the key to this cognitive efficiency is intelligent selection of the situations in which computational resources are spent. We tested this hypothesis in the domain of complex planning by analyzing how humans managed time available for thinking in over 12 million online chess matches. We found that players spent more time thinking in board positions where planning was more beneficial. This effect was greater in stronger players, and additionally strengthened by considering only the information available to the player at the time of choice. Finally, we found that the qualitative features of this relationship were consistent with a policy that considers the empirically-measured cost of spending time in chess. This provides evidence that human efficiency is supported by intelligent selection of when to apply computation.},

  abstract      = {We develop a satisficing model of choice in which the available alternatives differ in their inherent complexity. We assume--and experimentally validate--that complexity leads to errors in the perception of alternatives' values. The model yields sharp predictions about the effect of complexity on choice probabilities, some of which qualitatively contrast with those of maximization-based choice models. We confirm the predictions of the satisficing model--and thus reject maximization--in a novel data set with information on hundreds of millions of real-world chess moves by highly experienced players. These findings point to the importance of complexity and satisficing for decision making outside of the laboratory.},

  abstract      = {Decision-making researchers often face a trade-off when conducting controlled laboratory experiments, as these can limit the ability to identify stable relationships between decision-making quality and individual differences, such as expertise or personality traits. This study introduces an innovative paradigm that leverages the objective assessment capabilities of artificial intelligence in a naturalistic online chess setting. Ninety-four participants evaluated tactical chess positions and identified optimal moves under various time control conditions, followed by personality assessments. Expertise, measured by online Elo rating, emerged as a key predictor, accounting for 55~\% of the variance in decision quality and 61~\% in evaluation accuracy, underscoring the precision of the chosen approach. The study also highlights the significant impact of time control on decision-making. Additionally, the paradigm shows promise in examining the interplay between personality factors and decision-making processes, with a notable correlation between higher impulsivity scores and faster response times. However, high impulsivity was not associated with reduced decision quality, raising questions about the validity of this measurement. Overall, the results suggest that the chess paradigm, accessible to a broad sample due to the widespread appeal of online chess, provides a powerful tool that combines laboratory precision with real-world relevance.},

    This study aims to determine the results of the analysis of chess playing skills on mathematics learning outcomes for junior athletes of the Raja Kombi Trenggalek chess club. The research method used is a qualitative descriptive method with a quantitative approach. Participants in this study were 8 junior athletes of Raja Kombi Trenggalek chess club. Data collection techniques using interviews, skills results and documentation. The data analysis in this study used the mean and percentage formula.

    After analyzing the data, the results of this study concluded that in this study, the average score of playing chess skills was 85.00, then the average score of mathematics learning outcomes was 86.25. This is of course the higher the level of achievement of skills or intellectual intelligence, the higher the level of problem solving such as in learning mathematics. This is also influenced by motor and psychological aspects as a support for intelligence skills that affect the thinking of athletes. Then from the data analysis it can be said that the higher the level of achievement of chess playing skills, the higher the level of problem solving as in learning mathematics

We show how it is possible to investigate how the model capacity and the available number of training data influence the learning success of a language model with the help of chess-specific metrics. With these metrics, we show that more games used for training in the studied range offers significantly better results for the same training time. However, model size does not show such a clear influence. It is also interesting to observe that the usual evaluation metrics for language models, predictive accuracy and perplexity, give no indication of this here. Further examination of trained models reveals how they store information about board state in the activations of neuron groups, and how the overall sequence of previous moves influences the newly-generated moves.},

Each player's game is represented by a multidimensional vectorthat encodes information about the course of the game. There are threeapproaches to creating this vector, allowing us to focus on different aspects of the chess game. The proposed analysis was carried out with theintention of verifying the Topological Data Analysis as a tool for analyzing chess games. As a result, it was shown that Topological Data Analysiscan be a potential tool for recognizing the quality of a given player, if wehave enough number of his games, and to reconstruct player rankings. Asignificant result is also the potential for further research for which this thesis could be the foundation.},
