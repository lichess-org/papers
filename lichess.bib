  abstract      = {When generating levels, algorithmically evaluating the results is essential. In this paper, we looked at predicting a level's difficulty and enjoyment. Past work has approached this problem for puzzle games like Sudoku by analyzing the characteristics of the initial level, the solved level, and the process that led to that solution. In this work, we examined a set of heuristics for Roguelike levels and their solutions, and their relationship to subjective player ratings of the levels. We gathered ratings of difficulty and enjoyment of levels in a study with 143 players. We ran an ablation study on the set of heuristics to find the best combination of heuristics for predicting difficulty and enjoyment with a linear regression model, and found solution path-based heursitics performed well. However, these models did not outperform a simple baseline for predicting enjoyment. Jaccard similarity on paths--a method we have not seen used in the field of game AI--was a useful predictor of difficulty. Testing proximity to enemies across a solution path is the only heuristic needed to predict how enjoyable a level will be.},

  abstract      = {This report encompasses the implementation of two state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms for evaluating chess positions. The first algorithm makes use of artificial neural networks and manual feature representation thus closely following the implementation and architecture of Matthew Lai's Giraffe.  Giraffe learns to play chess largely by self-play and derives its own rules based on the data [1]. Giraffe was implemented as a 7 class classification problem on a dataset of over 10,000 grandmaster level games. Four different implementations of Giraffe were explored covering two different architectures and the effects of regularization on the model performance. The second algorithm implemented goes through an unsupervised learning phase to perform feature extraction followed by a supervised learning phase thus replicating David Eli's DeepChess. DeepChess evaluates chess positions using a deep neural network without any a priori knowledge regarding the rules of chess. DeepChess is implemented as a siamese network of two disjoint deep belief networks connected to each other by fully connected layers [2]. This architecture was implemented as a binary classification problem on the same dataset as Giraffe and also on a larger dataset of LiChess games. Different implementations of DeepChess covering different training methodologies and parameter sets were executed.},

  abstract      = {WebAssembly (Wasm for short) brings a new, powerful capability to the web as well as Edge, IoT, and embedded systems. Wasm is a portable, compact binary code format with high performance and robust sandboxing properties. As Wasm applications grow in size and importance, the complex performance characteristics of diverse Wasm engines demand robust, representative benchmarks for proper tuning. Stopgap benchmark suites, such as PolyBenchC and libsodium, continue to be used in the literature, though they are known to be unrepresentative. Porting of more complex suites remains difficult because Wasm lacks many system APIs and extracting real-world Wasm benchmarks from the web is difficult due to complex host interactions. To address this challenge, we introduce Wasm-R3, the first record and replay technique for Wasm. Wasm-R3 transparently injects instrumentation into Wasm modules to record an execution trace from inside the module, then reduces the execution trace via several optimizations, and finally produces a replay module that is executable standalone without any host environment-on any engine. The benchmarks created by our approach are (i) realistic, because the approach records real-world web applications, (ii) faithful to the original execution, because the replay benchmark includes the unmodified original code, only adding emulation of host interactions, and (iii) standalone, because the replay benchmarks run on any engine. Applying Wasm-R3 to web-based Wasm applications in the wild demonstrates the correctness of our approach as well as the effectiveness of our optimizations, which reduce the recorded traces by 99.53\% and the size of the replay benchmark by 9.98\%. We release the resulting benchmark suite of 27 applications, called Wasm-R3-Bench, to the community, to inspire a new generation of realistic and standalone Wasm benchmarks.},

Recently, however, attempts have been made to create engines that mimic the playing strength and style of human players. Our research proposes enhancements of models developed in this vein that more accurately imitate master-level players, as well as improve the prediction accuracy of existing models on weaker players. Our proposed enhancements are simple to apply by post-processing the output of existing chess engines. The performance of our enhancements was evaluated and compared using two metrics, prediction accuracy and average centipawn loss. We found that using an ensemble model over search depths maximised prediction accuracy, while an evaluation window filtering approach was preferable with respect to average centipawn loss.},

    Recent progress in machine learning has been fueled by increasing scale, enabling breakthroughs in domains such as image generation, natural language understanding, and decision-making. While tremendous improvements have been realized for low-risk applications like chat completion and recommendation, there are fundamental challenges that need to be addressed for high-risk applications like robotics and security. Specifically, this thesis is motivated by the following issues: (1) Collecting large datasets often relies on crowdsourcing, which inevitably introduces heterogeneous and potentially suboptimal data. (2) Applications that require coordination between multiple agents are often coupled with risk, making it challenging to use decentralized learning algorithms. (3) While neural networks have demonstrated tremendous predictive capabilities, they are inherently fragile to adversarial attacks. In this thesis, we present algorithms for combatting these challenges within the domains of Reinforcement Learning and Adversarial Machine Learning.

    The first contribution introduces two algorithms for imitation learning in suboptimal settings, demonstrating that by modeling the suboptimalities present, we can improve the learning framework. The second contribution proposes a mechanism to encourage cooperation in multi-agent reinforcement learning, demonstrating that by allowing agents to gift part of their reward, we can promote prosocial behavior in a decentralized fashion. The third contribution develops a robust classification algorithm designed for sparse attacks, demonstrating that by extending our theoretical insights from idealized settings, we can combat adversarial attacks in neural network classifiers. We test our proposed algorithms across applications in image-classification, game-playing, and robotics. Together, these contributions aim to advance the deployment of machine learning in real-world scenarios by considering practical problem settings, presenting novel theoretical and algorithmic insights, and validating these findings empirically.

By encoding chess tactical problems as text documents, we use information retrieval techniques to enable efficient approximate searches. We have also developed a method for automatically generating tactical puzzles from a collection of chess games. We have experimentally shown the importance of including both static and dynamic features for successful recognition of similar chess motifs. The experiments have clearly shown that dynamic similarity plays a very important role in the evaluation of the similarity of chess motifs by both the program and chess experts.},

  abstract      = {Over the last decade, the amount of data generated by software applications e.g. information systems, websites, mobile applications etc. has increased tremendously. Process mining, a subdiscipline of data science, uses this data to analyse and improve processes. In this research, the possibilities of process mining on chess event logs are explored, to ultimately improve the chess Elo system. The chess Elo system is a widely used and well accepted rating system. The Elo system is, however,  flawed in multiple ways. Two major flaws of the Elo system, are its incapability to review a player?s strength and the excessive time needed to gain the appropriate Elo rating. This research explores the potential of process mining to identify chess expertise. To be more specific, multiple process mining techniques are applied on chess event logs, and the generated process models are analysed to identify chess expertise. This research presents a method to analyse the differences between high and low rated players. This is achieved by comparing process models generated from high and low rated chess games. The results show that by comparing the process models differences between high and low rated players can be observed. Process mining is therefore a promising approach to improve the Elo system and might be applicable to other software too. However, only the first twelve moves of a game were used. To gain more insight into the differences between high and low rated players, the mid and end games should be included in the event logs as well. Future research should be conducted with more chess games added to the event logs to increase the validity.},

Here we quantify human performance in the popular game of chess by leveraging a very large dataset comprising of over 120 million games between almost 1 million players. We find that individuals encounter hot streaks of repeated success, longer for beginners than for expert players, and even longer cold streaks of unsatisfying performance. Skilled players can be distinguished from the others based on their gaming behaviour. Differences appear from the very first moves of the game, with experts tending to specialize and repeat the same openings while beginners explore and diversify more. However, experts experience a broader response repertoire, and display a deeper understanding of different variations within the same line. Over time, the opening diversity of a player tends to decrease, hinting at the development of individual playing styles. Nevertheless, we find that players are often not able to recognize their most successful openings. Overall, our work contributes to quantifying human performance in competitive settings, providing a first large-scale quantitative analysis of individual careers in chess, helping unveil the determinants separating elite from beginner performance.},

However, less is known about the prevalence of white's advantage in games played between amateurs in more casual settings. This article attempts to identify a first-move advantage in chess by examining a large database of amateur games played online on a dedicated chess website. Win rates are calculated for various rating levels, and the influence of opening move choice is also explored. These results can help determine whether there is an inherent first-move advantage in chess observable for all players in multiple settings, or if this effect is exclusively seen with players of high skill during games played in person.},

  abstract      = {Machine learning (ML) systems across many application areas are increasingly demonstrating performance that is beyond that of humans. In response to the proliferation of such models, the field of Explainable AI (XAI) has sought to develop techniques that enhance the transparency and interpretability of machine learning methods. In this work, we consider a question not previously explored within the XAI and ML communities: Given a computational system whose performance exceeds that of its human user, can explainable AI capabilities be leveraged to improve the performance of the human? We study this question in the context of the game of Chess, for which computational game engines that surpass the performance of the average player are widely available. We introduce the Rationale-Generating Algorithm, an automated technique for generating rationales for utility-based computational methods, which we evaluate with a multi-day user study against two baselines. The results show that our approach produces rationales that lead to statistically significant improvement in human task performance, demonstrating that rationales automatically generated from an AI's internal task model can be used not only to explain what the system is doing, but also to instruct the user and ultimately improve their task performance.},

In this paper, we use the games played in an online chess platform to exploit the ``wisdom of the crowd'' and answer questions traditionally tackled only by chess experts. We first define a relatedness network of chess openings that quantifies how similar two openings are to play. Using this network, we identify communities of nodes corresponding to the most common opening choices and their mutual relationships. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the relatedness network can be used to forecast future openings players will start to play, with back-tested predictions outperforming a random predictor. We then apply the Economic Fitness and Complexity algorithm to measure the difficulty of openings and players' skill levels. Our study not only provides a new perspective on chess analysis but also opens the possibility of suggesting personalized opening recommendations using complex network theory.},

While these are critical benchmarks of progress, they also suffer from weakness due to artificial distributions and incomplete knowledge. Artifacts arising from artificial distributions can overstate language model performance, while incomplete knowledge limits fine-grained analysis. In this work, we introduce a complementary benchmarking approach based on SimPlified Language Activity Traces (SPLAT). SPLATs are corpora of language encodings of activity in some closed domain (we study traces from chess and baseball games in this work). SPLAT datasets use naturally-arising distributions, allow the generation of question-answer pairs at scale, and afford complete knowledge in their closed domains. We show that language models of three different architectures can answer questions about world states using only verb-like encodings of activity. Our approach is extensible to new language models and additional question-answering tasks.},

Aiming to address this limitation, we present Easy2Hard-Bench, a consistently formatted collection of 6 benchmark datasets spanning various domains, such as mathematics and programming problems, chess puzzles, and reasoning questions. Each problem within these datasets is annotated with numerical difficulty scores. To systematically estimate problem difficulties, we collect abundant performance data on attempts to each problem by humans in the real world or LLMs on the prominent leaderboard. Leveraging the rich performance data, we apply well-established difficulty ranking systems, such as Item Response Theory (IRT) and Glicko-2 models, to uniformly assign numerical difficulty scores to problems. Moreover, datasets in Easy2Hard-Bench distinguish themselves from previous collections by a higher proportion of challenging problems. Through extensive experiments with six state-of-the-art LLMs, we provide a comprehensive analysis of their performance and generalization capabilities across varying levels of difficulty, with the aim of inspiring future research in LLM generalization.

In the current study, focused on the game of chess, we investigated whether chess players could distinguish if they were playing against a human or a computer, and how they achieved this. A total of 24 chess players each played eight 5+0 Blitz games from different starting positions. They played against (1) a human, (2) Maia, a neural network-based chess engine trained to play in a human-like manner, (3) Stockfish 16, the best chess engine available, downgraded to play at a lower level, and (4) Stockfish 16 at its maximal level. The opponent's move time was fixed at 10 seconds. During the game, participants verbalized their thoughts, and after each game, they indicated by means of a questionnaire whether they thought they had played against a human or a machine and if there were particular moves that revealed the nature of the opponent. The results showed that Stockfish at the highest level was usually correctly identified as an engine, while Maia was often incorrectly identified as a human. The moves of the downgraded Stockfish were relatively often labeled as `strange' by the participants. In conclusion, the Turing test, as applied here in a domain where computers can perform superhumanly, is essentially a test of whether the chess computer can devise suboptimal moves that correspond to human moves, and not necessarily a test of computer intelligence.},

In this study, 28 high school students who were active in chess and participated in provincial and national chess leagues were selected. Based on the NEO Five-Factor Inventory of personality traits, they were divided into two groups: 14 extroverted students (17 \pm{} 0.88) and 14 introverted students (16.5 \pm{} 1.02). Each participant attended three separate sessions in the laboratory, with a minimum 72-hour rest period between sessions. In each session, participants performed the Iowa Gambling Task and the Lichess computer game before any stimulation. They were then subjected to one of three conditions: right anodal/left cathodal, right cathodal/left anodal, or sham stimulation, for 20 minutes at 2 mA intensity over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. After the stimulation, participants repeated the Iowa Gambling Task and the Lichess computer game. Data analysis using two-way mixed ANOVA revealed a significant difference in the Iowa Gambling Task between right anodal/left cathodal and right cathodal/left anodal stimulation based on personality traits (p = 0.001). The findings of this study indicated that transcranial direct current stimulation had a differential effect on decision-making in chess players based on their personality traits. Specifically, the study's results showed that extroverted players exhibited more risk-taking behaviour, while introverted players acted more cautiously.},

  annote        = {Chess is a strategy board game with its inception dating back to the 15th century. The Covid-19 pandemic has led to a chess boom online with 95,853,038 chess games being played during January, 2021 on lichess.com. Along with the chess boom, instances of cheating have also become more rampant. Classifications have been used for anomaly detection in different fields and thus it is a natural idea to develop classifiers to detect cheating in chess. However, there are no specific examples of this, and it is difficult to obtain data where cheating has occurred. So, in this paper, we develop 4 machine learning classifiers, Linear Discriminant Analysis, Quadratic Discriminant Analysis, Multinomial Logistic Regression, and K-Nearest Neighbour classifiers to predict chess game results and explore predictors that produce the best accuracy performance. We use Confusion Matrix, K Fold Cross-Validation, and Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation methods to find the accuracy metrics. There are three phases of analysis. In phase I, we train classifiers using 1.94 million over the board game as training data and 20 thousand online games as testing data and obtain accuracy metrics. In phase II, we select a smaller pool of 212 games, select additional predictor variables from chess engine evaluation of the moves played in those games and check whether the inclusion of the variables improve performance. Finally, in phase III, we investigate for patterns in misclassified cases to define anomalies. From phase I, the models are not performing at a utilizable level of accuracy (44-63\%). For all classifiers, it is no better than deciding the class with a coin toss. K-Nearest Neighbour with K = 7 was the best model. In phase II, adding the new predictors improved the performance of all the classifiers significantly across all validation methods. In fact, using only significant variables as predictors produced highly accurate classifiers. Finally, from phase III, we could not find any patterns or significant differences between the predictors for both correct classifications and misclassifications. In conclusion, machine learning classification is only one useful tool to spot instances that indicates anomalies. However, we cannot simply judge anomalous games using only this method.},

In this project, I utilize language pretaining; instruction fine-tuning, an additional training regimen with chess-specific tasks presented in natural language; and chain-of-thought prompting, a natural language description of problem reasoning prepended to the answer of a problem, to improve the performance of LLMs at chess move generation (validity/legality and quality of moves). I show that fine-tuned GPT-2-XL, a 1.5B parameter LLM, performs favorably well at move generation compared to ChatGPT with few-shot learning; I also validate the additional benefits of chain-of-thought prompting compared to plain prompts in ChatGPT while highlighting tradeoffs between the quality of natural language and the quality of chess when more verbose prompts are used in the smaller GPT-2-XL.},

Object recognition in images is one area where computer vision can contribute to significant improvements. Playing chess, one of the oldest and most challenging intellectual games requires concentration and tactical thinking. In computer vision, automating the recognition of chessboards and figures can contribute to developing advanced chess applications, help users analyse games, or even enable a game with a computer based on real-world chess setups. This paper describes how the system for recognising chessboards and figures using computer vision techniques was developed and implemented. Through analysing existing methods, designing a new algorithm, and experimental evaluation, the goal is to create an accurate and efficient system that can recognise chess positions and individual figures based on images.},

  abstract      = {This study presents a few-shot embedding learning approach to predict the behavior of individual chess players, based on only 100 games. Traditional models have relied on extensive datasets, often requiring thousands of games to achieve accurate move predictions. In contrast, our method leverages a limited number of games to generate dense vector representations, or embeddings, that capture a player's unique style. We trained a neural network to create these embeddings and used them to predict subsequent moves. Our results indicate that the embedding model performs well across various player sets and can accurately identify players even at scale among a great player population, picking out players with 84\% accuracy from among 100k candidates. There are indications that including information on the clock situation during the game improves the embedding process, although our findings are inconclusive. Despite these limitations, our approach shows promise in making personalized chess training more accessible and highlights the potential for embedding learning in human-centered AI applications. Future work will aim to refine both the embedding and move prediction models and explore its application in other domains.},

We apply dimensionality reduction (PCA, t-SNE, MDS) and clustering (K-means) to build style-based player maps, measuring similarities through Jensen–Shannon divergence. Results show consistent stylistic signatures for some players--such as Firouzja and Dubov but may fail with others e.g. Nepomniachtchi. We also confirmed the evolution of chess player's still accros time. Though the approach is promising, limitations remain, especially in data size and the influence of forced lines.

  abstract      = {Abstract Gambits are central to human decision-making. Our goal is to provide a theory of Gambits. A Gambit is a combination of psychological and technical factors designed to disrupt predictable play. Chess provides an environment to study gambits and behavioral game theory. Our theory is based on the Bellman optimality path for sequential decision-making. This allows us to calculate the Q\$\$ Q \$\$-values of a Gambit where material (usually a pawn) is sacrificed for dynamic play. On the empirical side, we study the effectiveness of a number of popular chess Gambits. This is a natural setting as chess Gambits require a sequential assessment of a set of moves (a.k.a. policy) after the Gambit has been accepted. Our analysis uses Stockfish 14.1 to calculate the optimal Bellman Q\$\$ Q \$\$-values, which fundamentally measures if a position is winning or losing. To test whether Bellman's equation holds in play, we estimate the transition probabilities to the next board state via a database of expert human play. This then allows us to test whether the Gambiteer is following the optimal path in his decision-making. Our methodology is applied to the popular Stafford and reverse Stafford (a.k.a. Boden–Kieretsky–Morphy) Gambit and other common ones including the Smith–Morra, Goring, Danish and Halloween Gambits. We build on research in human decision-making by proving an irrational skewness preference within agents in chess. We conclude with directions for future research.},

Through rigorous experimentation, including self-play, matchups against a variant of the renowned program, Go-deep experiments, and score deviations, we present compelling evidence for the effectiveness of a weighted sum of both evaluations. Remarkably, in our experiments, the combination of 75\% neural network and 25\% traditional evaluation consistently emerged as the most effective choice. Furthermore, we introduce the use of Best-Change rates, which have previously been associated with evaluation quality, in the context of Monte Carlo tree search-based algorithms.},

  abstract      = {With the development of chess engines, cheating online has never been easier, resulting in a need for more robust and accurate detection systems. This paper presents a novel approach to chess cheater detection that combines conventional chess engines and neural networks to help identify which games are authentically played by humans and which show signs of extraneous intervention. By utilizing Stockfish to measure centipawn loss and its mathematical derivatives, we can measure deviations from typical computer-generated moves much like in conventional anti-cheat systems. Additionally, the neural network Maia, designed specifically to mimic human play, transmutes centipawn loss data to highlight deviations from human style. This dual-measurement system addresses the limitations of the given traditional anti-cheat systems, which face the issue of distinguishing between strong human players and those using engines. The collected metadata is analyzed using a sequential neural network, which identifies patterns of fair play violation. Our approach offers a robust solution for maintaining the integrity of online chess by accurately detecting and preventing cheating.},

  abstract      = {Context: This study aims to confirm, replicate and extend the findings of a previous article entitled ''Metamorphic Testing of Chess Engines'' that reported inconsistencies in the analyses provided by Stockfish, the most widely used chess engine, for transformed chess positions that are fundamentally identical. Initial findings, under conditions strictly identical to those of the original study, corroborate the reported inconsistencies. Objective: However, the original article considers a specific dataset (including randomly generated chess positions, end-games, or checkmate problems) and very low analysis depth (10 plies11A ply refers to a single turn taken by one player in a game. Two plies, one from each player, together constitute a complete move., corresponding to 5 moves). These decisions pose threats that limit generalizability of the results, but also their practical usefulness both for chess players and maintainers of Stockfish. Thus, we replicate the original study. Methods: We consider this time (1) positions derived from actual chess games, (2) analyses at appropriate and larger depths, and (3) different versions of Stockfish. We conduct novel experiments on thousands of positions, employing significantly deeper searches. Results: The replication results show that the Stockfish chess engines demonstrate significantly greater consistency in its evaluations. The metamorphic relations are not as effective as in the original article, especially on realistic chess positions. We also demonstrate that, for any given position, there exists a depth threshold beyond which further increases in depth do not result in any evaluation differences for the studied metamorphic relations. We perform an in-depth analysis to identify and clarify the implementation reasons behind Stockfish's inconsistencies when dealing with transformed positions. Conclusion: A first concrete result is thus that metamorphic testing of chess engines is not yet an effective technique for finding faults of Stockfish. Another result is the lessons learned through this replication effort: metamorphic relations must be verified in the context of the domain's specificities; without such contextual validation, they may lead to misleading or irrelevant conclusions; changes in parameters and input dataset can drastically alter the effectiveness of a testing method.},

  abstract      = {As online platforms become ubiquitous, there is growing concern that their use can potentially lead to negative outcomes in users' personal lives, such as disrupted sleep and impacted social relationships. A central question in the literature studying these problematic effects is whether they are associated with the amount of time users spend on online platforms. This is often addressed by either analyzing self-reported measures of time spent online, which are generally inaccurate, or using objective metrics derived from server logs or tracking software. Nonetheless, how the two types of time measures comparatively relate to problematic effects -- whether they complement or are redundant with each other in predicting problematicity -- remains unknown. Additionally, transparent research into this question is hindered by the literature's focus on closed platforms with inaccessible data, as well as selective analytical decisions that may lead to reproducibility issues.In this work, we investigate how both self-reported and data-derived metrics of time spent relate to potentially problematic effects arising from the use of an open, non-profit online chess platform. These effects include disruptions to sleep, relationships, school and work performance, and self-control. To this end, we distributed a gamified survey to players and linked their responses with publicly-available game logs. We find problematic effects to be associated with both self-reported and data-derived usage measures to similar degrees. However, analytical models incorporating both self-reported and actual time explain problematic effects significantly more effectively than models with either type of measure alone. Furthermore, these results persist across thousands of possible analytical decisions when using a robust and transparent statistical framework. This suggests that the two methods of measuring time spent measure contain distinct, complementary information about problematic usage outcomes and should be used in conjunction with each other.},

From social networks connecting us to each other, to content providers keeping us perpetually entertained, to search engines serving each of our informational needs, to computational models informing us how healthy we are, to artificially-intelligent coaches supplementing our natural intelligence, every corner of human existence is permeated by the digital tools we create. Accompanying the boons of these systems, however, are increasingly complex risks to our digital health. Our attention is pulled into cyberspace via algorithms that use billions of datapoints to learn what we like, sometimes to the detriment of our physical wellness. Ideological rifts online threaten our societal harmony as partisans become ever more polarized, whose obsession with political content in turn feeds the underbelly of our social media ecosystem. All the while, the same data underpinning these online interactions also allow others to make finely-optimized decisions about us, often to the detriment of the disadvantaged. This thesis offers a more optimistic vision: that the same computational infrastructure powering our potentially perilous systems can be repurposed to help us understand their perils. We first outline a framework for rigorously assessing the welfare of our digital systems through the well-being of individual users, the cohesion of user communities, and whether the systems themselves deserve trust. We then utilize this framework to conduct four empirical studies measuring the extent to which digital welfare is preserved or endangered by data-driven systems. At the level of individual users, we directly measure how spending time on a large-scale chess platform, Lichess, can be perceived as detrimental to personal well-being. We find that perceived harms are explained not only by the time that people believe they spend online, but also the actual time they spend engaging with the platform. For groups of users, we quantify how partisan users on the Reddit platform are selective towards politically-congruent news outlets, thus consuming and disseminating polarized news. Despite the platform appearing polarized on aggregate, we discover that narrow, hyper-partisan communities are responsible for deeply-ingrained ideological segregation. We then extend this result by identifying whether key individuals can influence the news consumption cycle on Reddit. Through an analysis of where news about political figures is shared on Reddit and the language it attracts, we illustrate that nationally-recognizable politicians are selectively discussed more by in-group online communities than they are by in-group news outlets. Out-group communities, on the other hand, generate the most toxic and hateful commentary. At the level of problematic downstream outcomes, we further probe whether people can tell when systems like algorithmic risk assessments harm data subjects in unfair ways. We find that observers are easily distracted by who makes risk assessments rather than how equitable the assessments are, suggesting that the task of welfare measurement itself needs to be made accessible for laypeople at large. This thesis posits that the online social systems jeopardizing our collective welfare can also be used to understand the very dangers they pose. By empirically measuring how well people are doing when they use or are impacted by these systems, we in turn empirically demonstrate the feasibility of this ideal. We conclude by speculating on the imminent ubiquity of artificial intelligence in our cyber-environment and their implications for the work in this thesis.},

We distinguish whether security schemes are introduced locally (at the path or operation level) or globally (for the entire API). Our analysis highlights scenarios where security schemes are featured in APIs in different proportions over time, thus tracking whether the API documentation tends to include more (or less) security details as the API evolves.},

  abstract      = {Generative large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing (NLP) by demonstrating exceptional performance in interpreting and generating human language. There has been some exploration of their application to non-linguistic tasks, which could lead to significant advancements in fields that rely heavily on structured data and specialized knowledge. However, there has been limited direct comparison of the effects of model adaptation techniques for non-linguistic compared to linguistic tasks with LLMs. To this end, the work in this paper investigates the effects of fine-tuning and few-shot learning on pre-trained LLMs for non-linguistic tasks using chess puzzles as a case study task. We compare the impact of fine-tuning and few-shot learning on models performing the same task represented in both chess notation (i.e., non-linguistic data) and natural language descriptions of the same chess notations (i.e., natural language data). Our experiments with Mixtral-8x7B-v0.1 and Meta-Llama-3-70B resulted in a 5\% lower average increase in performance after fine-tuning for non-linguistic tasks compared to linguistic tasks. Similarly, few-shot learning on pre-trained models exhibited a 3\% lower average increase in performance for on non-linguistic tasks compared to linguistic tasks. Furthermore, few-shot learning on fine-tuned models resulted in a significant accuracy drop, particularly for Mixtral, with a 24.82\% decrease for non-linguistic tasks. These results suggest that fine-tuning and few-shot learning for generative LLMs have stronger effects on linguistic tasks and their data than for non-linguistic.},

Such exploration spawned what has become the benchmark of evaluating professional chess players since the 1970s: the Elo rating model. The Elo system, the first to have a sound statistical basis, was designed by Elo (1978) from the assumption that the performance of a player in a game is a normally distributed random variable Alliot (2017). However, this ranking model is not without its limitations and such has led to extreme rating deflation of the World Chess Federation (FIDE) Standard Elo rating system Sonas (2023). Such attention on the FIDE's rating mechanism has ignited focus on the Elo system's drawbacks which we will address in this dissertation.},

In this paper we present a technique which connects game embeddings, a recent method for modelling game dynamics from log data, and word embeddings, which models semantic information about language. We explain two different approaches for using game embeddings in this way, and show evidence that game embeddings enhance the linguistic translations of game concepts from one theme to another, opening up exciting new possibilities for reasoning about the thematic elements of games in the future.},

Chess agents designed for human-agent play are capable of adjusting their level, however their style is not aligned with that of human players. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for designing such agents by integrating the theory of chess players' decision-making with a state-of-the-art Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm. We demonstrate the benefits of our approach using two sets of analyses. Quantitatively, we establish that the agents attain their desired Elo ratings. Qualitatively, through a Turing-inspired test with a human chess expert, we show that our agents are indistinguishable from human players.},

  abstract      = {Although artificial intelligence systems can now outperform humans in a variety of domains, they still lag behind in the ability to arrive at good solutions to problems using limited resources. Recent proposals have suggested that the key to this cognitive efficiency is intelligent selection of the situations in which computational resources are spent. We tested this hypothesis in the domain of complex planning by analyzing how humans managed time available for thinking in over 12 million online chess matches. We found that players spent more time thinking in board positions where planning was more beneficial. This effect was greater in stronger players, and additionally strengthened by considering only the information available to the player at the time of choice. Finally, we found that the qualitative features of this relationship were consistent with a policy that considers the empirically-measured cost of spending time in chess. This provides evidence that human efficiency is supported by intelligent selection of when to apply computation.},

  abstract      = {The rapidly evolving field of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) faces a fundamental constraint: the limited bandwidth of information exchange between users and computing systems. One promising approach to increasing this bandwidth is implicit interaction: a paradigm in which applications modify their state based on information gleaned from users, rather than direct input. Within the context of reading such information from human neural signals, this concept is formally recognized as implicit Brain-Computer Interfaces (implicit BCI). My work focuses on implicit BCIs which measure the prefrontal cortex (PFC); early prototypes have successfully leveraged the PFC to approximate mental workload, but much is left to be understood about the full potential of this region. Through three research projects spanning two brain measurement modalities, this dissertation makes targeted contributions to this area of research. With functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS), I explore two facets of PFC activation demonstrated in functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI)-based neuroscience research which are underexplored in applied contexts: episodic memory and brain-network based classification; in the first project, I study the measurable effects of episodic and working memory within the context of using Large Language Models (LLMs), and in the second project I develop a real-time implicit BCI designed to differentiate between different brain networks. The third project benchmarks low-cost EEG in three studies which distinguish brain states based on different factors: quality of moves made during chess playing, workload levels within standard cognitive psychology tasks, and cognitive states during the tasks. For all studies I use Linear Mixed Models (LMM) to observe macro patterns in the data, and machine learning to explore potential for implicit BCI. Results indicate that, in addition to the well-understood concept of measuring singular aspects of consciousness across a gradient (e.g. workload), promising potential exists for leveraging the PFC towards classification across tasks which engage different cognitive processes, both with fNIRS and low-cost EEG. Further, careful consideration of ``noise'' in implicit BCI introduces a new idea: Human-Sensor-Computer Interaction (HSCI). Taken together, this dissertation provides relevant context to inform the next generation of Human-Sensor-Computer systems, including PFC-based interfaces stretching past workload, and beyond.},

The method that we present aims to train different ANN architectures to understand chess positions similarly to how highly rated human players do. We investigate the capabilities that ANNs have when it comes to pattern recognition, an ability that distinguishes chess grandmasters from more amateurplayers. We collect around 3,000,000 different chess positions played by highly skilled chess players and label them with the evaluation function of Stockfish, one of the strongest existing chess engines. We create 4 different datasets from scratch that are used for different classification and regression experiments. The results show how relatively simple Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) outperform Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in all the experiments that we have performed. We also investigate two different board representations, the first one representing if a piece is present on the board or not, and the second one in which we assign a numerical value to the piece according to its strength. Our results show how the latter input representation influences the performances of the ANNs negatively in almost all experiments.},

We confirm the predictions of the satisficing model--and thus reject maximization--in a novel data set with information on hundreds of millions of real-world chess moves by highly experienced players. These findings point to the importance of complexity and satisficing for decision making outside of the laboratory.},

Consistent with well-established regularities regarding the inner workings of human memory, the memory premium is associative, subject to interference and repetition effects, and decays over time. Even as decision makers gain familiarity with the environment, the memory premium remains economically large. Our results imply that the ease with which past experiences come to mind plays an important role in shaping choice behavior.},

The primary objective of this study is to investigate the impact of custom notation systems and tokenisation methods specifically designed for use with chess games. The study aims to improve the models' understanding of game states and move sequences by developing and implementing a custom notation system, xLAN+. This notation system incorporates additional information about captures, checks and checkmates in order to increase the performance of the models. Furthermore, the strategic gameplay capabilities of the models are to be enhanced by fine-tuning them on datasets filtered by Elo rating. This approach postulates that filtering games by skill level can help models develop a deeper understanding of strategic gameplay, thereby improving their ability to generate high-quality moves. The research uses two different architectures, Transformer, based on OpenAI's GPT-2 configuration, and Mamba, a State Space Model (SSM) optimised for long sequence processing. Initial findings indicate that the custom notation xLAN+ significantly improves the models' ability to generate valid moves and maintain game state accuracy over extended sequences. The comparison between GPT-2 and Mamba reveals that while both architectures can learn chess rules and generate plausible moves, the SSM offers slight advantages in handling long-range dependencies and maintaining game context. This project demonstrates the potential of language models to learn complex tasks like chess through data-driven approaches, paving the way for their application in other strategic and decision-making domains.},

This study introduces an innovative paradigm that leverages the objective assessment capabilities of artificial intelligence in a naturalistic online chess setting. Ninety-four participants evaluated tactical chess positions and identified optimal moves under various time control conditions, followed by personality assessments. Expertise, measured by online Elo rating, emerged as a key predictor, accounting for 55~\% of the variance in decision quality and 61~\% in evaluation accuracy, underscoring the precision of the chosen approach. The study also highlights the significant impact of time control on decision-making. Additionally, the paradigm shows promise in examining the interplay between personality factors and decision-making processes, with a notable correlation between higher impulsivity scores and faster response times. However, high impulsivity was not associated with reduced decision quality, raising questions about the validity of this measurement. Overall, the results suggest that the chess paradigm, accessible to a broad sample due to the widespread appeal of online chess, provides a powerful tool that combines laboratory precision with real-world relevance.},

We show how it is possible to investigate how the model capacity and the available number of training data influence the learning success of a language model with the help of chess-specific metrics. With these metrics, we show that more games used for training in the studied range offers significantly better results for the same training time. However, model size does not show such a clear influence. It is also interesting to observe that the usual evaluation metrics for language models, predictive accuracy and perplexity, give no indication of this here. Further examination of trained models reveals how they store information about board state in the activations of neuron groups, and how the overall sequence of previous moves influences the newly-generated moves.},

We investigate whether a simple convolutional neural network can be trained to evaluate chess positions by means of predicting Stockfish (an existing chess engine) evaluations. Publicly available data from lichess.org was used, and we obtained a final MSE of 863.48 and MAE of 12.18 on our test dataset (with labels ranging from -255 to +255). To accomplish better results, we conclude that a more capable model architecture must be used.},

  abstract      = {Lossless data compression has evolved into an indispensable tool for reducing data transfer times in heterogeneous systems. However, performing decompression on host systems can create performance bottlenecks. Accelerator libraries, such as nvCOMP, address this problem by providing custom GPU-enabled versions of some general-purpose compression methods, including Snappy, ZStandard and gzip. However, popular bzip-like compression schemes, which rely on block-sorting transforms have not yet been integrated since their fine-grained parallelization is challenging. With a focus on decompression, we propose novel techniques for fine-grained parallelization of inverse Burrows-Wheeler transform (iBWT) and inverse Move-to-Front (iMTF) transform on GPUs, which enable efficient processing of bzip2-based archives on CUDA-enabled accelerators for the first time. Consequently, we present the first fully GPU-enabled bzip2 decompression pipeline as a use case for the proposed algorithms. Our experimental results reveal speedups of up to 6.1x over a multicore CPU implementation for iBWT, and throughput rates of up to 2400 MB/s for combined iBWT and iMTF on an A100 GPU. For decompression of bzip2 archives, a throughput of over 11.62 GB/s is achieved on a DGX H100 server. The source code of our parallel decoder implementation is available at https://github.com/weissenberger/bzip2gpu.},

The purpose of the analysis was to distinguish groups of players and players with the highest ranking from eachother. Each player's game is represented by a multidimensional vectorthat encodes information about the course of the game. There are threeapproaches to creating this vector, allowing us to focus on different aspects of the chess game. The proposed analysis was carried out with theintention of verifying the Topological Data Analysis as a tool for analyzing chess games. As a result, it was shown that Topological Data Analysiscan be a potential tool for recognizing the quality of a given player, if wehave enough number of his games, and to reconstruct player rankings. Asignificant result is also the potential for further research for which this thesis could be the foundation.},
