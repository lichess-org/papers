  abstract = {From sports to science, the recent availability of large-scale data has allowed to gain insights on the drivers of human innovation and success in a variety of domains. Here we quantify human performance in the popular game of chess by leveraging a very large dataset comprising of over 120 million games between almost 1 million players. We find that individuals encounter hot streaks of repeated success, longer for beginners than for expert players, and even longer cold streaks of unsatisfying performance. Skilled players can be distinguished from the others based on their gaming behaviour. Differences appear from the very first moves of the game, with experts tending to specialize and repeat the same openings while beginners explore and diversify more. However, experts experience a broader response repertoire, and display a deeper understanding of different variations within the same line. Over time, the opening diversity of a player tends to decrease, hinting at the development of individual playing styles. Nevertheless, we find that players are often not able to recognize their most successful openings. Overall, our work contributes to quantifying human performance in competitive settings, providing a first large-scale quantitative analysis of individual careers in chess, helping unveil the determinants separating elite from beginner performance.},

  abstract  = {Machine learning (ML) systems across many application areas are increasingly demonstrating performance that is beyond that of humans. In response to the proliferation of such models, the field of Explainable AI (XAI) has sought to develop techniques that enhance the transparency and interpretability of machine learning methods. In this work, we consider a question not previously explored within the XAI and ML communities: Given a computational system whose performance exceeds that of its human user, can explainable AI capabilities be leveraged to improve the performance of the human? We study this question in the context of the game of Chess, for which computational game engines that surpass the performance of the average player are widely available. We introduce the Rationale-Generating Algorithm, an automated technique for generating rationales for utility-based computational methods, which we evaluate with a multi-day user study against two baselines. The results show that our approach produces rationales that lead to statistically significant improvement in human task performance, demonstrating that rationales automatically generated from an AI's internal task model can be used not only to explain what the system is doing, but also to instruct the user and ultimately improve their task performance.},

  abstract = {Chess is a centuries-old game that continues to be widely played worldwide. Opening Theory is one of the pillars of chess and requires years of study to be mastered. In this paper, we use the games played in an online chess platform to exploit the ``wisdom of the crowd'' and answer questions traditionally tackled only by chess experts. We first define a relatedness network of chess openings that quantifies how similar two openings are to play. Using this network, we identify communities of nodes corresponding to the most common opening choices and their mutual relationships. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the relatedness network can be used to forecast future openings players will start to play, with back-tested predictions outperforming a random predictor. We then apply the Economic Fitness and Complexity algorithm to measure the difficulty of openings and players' skill levels. Our study not only provides a new perspective on chess analysis but also opens the possibility of suggesting personalized opening recommendations using complex network theory.},

  abstract = {With the growing capabilities of AI, technology is increasingly able to match or even surpass human performance. In the current study, focused on the game of chess, we investigated whether chess players could distinguish if they were playing against a human or a computer, and how they achieved this. A total of 24 chess players each played eight 5+0 Blitz games from different starting positions. They played against (1) a human, (2) Maia, a neural network-based chess engine trained to play in a human-like manner, (3) Stockfish 16, the best chess engine available, downgraded to play at a lower level, and (4) Stockfish 16 at its maximal level. The opponent’s move time was fixed at 10 seconds. During the game, participants verbalized their thoughts, and after each game, they indicated by means of a questionnaire whether they thought they had played against a human or a machine and if there were particular moves that revealed the nature of the opponent. The results showed that Stockfish at the highest level was usually correctly identified as an engine, while Maia was often incorrectly identified as a human. The moves of the downgraded Stockfish were relatively often labeled as ‘strange’ by the participants. In conclusion, the Turing test, as applied here in a domain where computers can perform superhumanly, is essentially a test of whether the chess computer can devise suboptimal moves that correspond to human moves, and not necessarily a test of computer intelligence.}

  abstract = {Abstract Gambits are central to human decision-making. Our goal is to provide a theory of Gambits. A Gambit is a combination of psychological and technical factors designed to disrupt predictable play. Chess provides an environment to study gambits and behavioral game theory. Our theory is based on the Bellman optimality path for sequential decision-making. This allows us to calculate the Q\$\$ Q \$\$-values of a Gambit where material (usually a pawn) is sacrificed for dynamic play. On the empirical side, we study the effectiveness of a number of popular chess Gambits. This is a natural setting as chess Gambits require a sequential assessment of a set of moves (a.k.a. policy) after the Gambit has been accepted. Our analysis uses Stockfish 14.1 to calculate the optimal Bellman Q\$\$ Q \$\$-values, which fundamentally measures if a position is winning or losing. To test whether Bellman's equation holds in play, we estimate the transition probabilities to the next board state via a database of expert human play. This then allows us to test whether the Gambiteer is following the optimal path in his decision-making. Our methodology is applied to the popular Stafford and reverse Stafford (a.k.a. Boden–Kieretsky–Morphy) Gambit and other common ones including the Smith–Morra, Goring, Danish and Halloween Gambits. We build on research in human decision-making by proving an irrational skewness preference within agents in chess. We conclude with directions for future research.},

  abstract = {Although artificial intelligence systems can now outperform humans in a variety of domains, they still lag behind in the ability to arrive at good solutions to problems using limited resources. Recent proposals have suggested that the key to this cognitive efficiency is intelligent selection of the situations in which computational resources are spent. We tested this hypothesis in the domain of complex planning by analyzing how humans managed time available for thinking in over 12 million online chess matches. We found that players spent more time thinking in board positions where planning was more beneficial. This effect was greater in stronger players, and additionally strengthened by considering only the information available to the player at the time of choice. Finally, we found that the qualitative features of this relationship were consistent with a policy that considers the empirically-measured cost of spending time in chess. This provides evidence that human efficiency is supported by intelligent selection of when to apply computation.},
